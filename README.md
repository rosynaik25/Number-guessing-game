# Number Guessing Game 🎯  
A simple project that taught me logic, problem-solving, and confidence in Python.

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a Python-based number guessing game named **Number-guessing.py**.  
The computer selects a random number, and the user tries to guess it using logical thinking and hints.

I came across a short video where two people were guessing numbers together.  
That small clip inspired me — it made me wonder how a similar engaging activity could be adapted for someone playing alone.

So, I decided to build this game as a fun way to relax, stay mentally active, and improve my programming skills.

## 💡 Why I Built This  
I built this project mainly for *personal learning*:

- I wanted to strengthen my understanding of *loops* and *conditional statements*.  
- I wanted to practice *problem-solving* and *user input handling*.  
- I wanted to turn a small idea from a video into something I could actually create myself.  

Through this project, I learned how to structure code, think logically, and debug effectively.  
It also helped me gain confidence in Python coding as a Class 11 student.
